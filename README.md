  ## Description:
  ### Deployed:  TBA <br /><br /> 
  This project has been fully refactored according to the requirements but contains a server error that has yet to be solved at the time of turning in. See error below: 
  <br />
  ![Server Error](assets/servererror.png) 
  <br /><br /> 
  To reproduce the error, clone this repository and `npm i` to install dependencies. Once installed, you can run `npm run develop` to start both the backend server and frontend. A user can signup or login but cannot save books due to the above error.
  
  <br /><br /> 
  This project is a refactor of a Google Books API search engine app with a RESTful API converted to a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. It is built using a MERN stack: React front end, MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server/API.

  The motivation behind this project was to update an application with modern technologies to create a better performing application.
